# **TotemRecall**

**TotemRecall** is a lightweight utility addon that provides customization for the default totem interface. It allows you to reposition, restyle, and enhance the visibility of your totems to better suit your personalized UI layout.

## **Features**

* **Custom Positioning & Scaling**: Move the totem frame anywhere on your screen by setting a custom parent frame and choosing specific anchor points. Adjust the icon scale from 50% to 250% to match your UI.  
* **Dynamic Growth Directions**: Control how your totem icons expand when multiple totems are active. Choose between horizontal (Left/Right) or vertical (Up/Down) growth.  
* **Square Icon Masks**: Modernize the default Blizzard UI by toggling square masks, which replace the standard round borders for both icons and cooldown swipes.  
* **Enhanced Timer Management**:  
  * **Independent Offsets**: Move the duration text (timers) precisely using X and Y offset sliders.  
  * **SharedMedia Support**: Choose any font installed in your game (via LibSharedMedia) for your totem timers.  
  * **Styling Options**: Customize font size, outlines (Thin, Thick, or None), and a built-in shadow for maximum readability.  
* **Profile Support**: Save different configurations for different talent specs or characters using the built-in profile system.

## **Commands**

Access the configuration menu using either of the following chat commands:

* /tr

*Note: Options are disabled during combat to ensure UI stability.*
